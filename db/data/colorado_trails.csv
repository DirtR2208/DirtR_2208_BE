131,Tabeguache Trail - Grand Valley Section,38.98861,-108.61732,blue,16.8,"The Tabeguache Trail is a historic motorized route connecting Grand Junction and Montrose (and likely an original route utilized by local Ute before pushed off by Europeans). It is comprised of several sections and all of them, with the exception of the section within the Lunch Loops, are motorized 4x4 trail/road. Combined, the sections create one third of the Grand Loop bikepacking adventure route. This route is the Granddaddy of bikepacking routes. This section starts at Bangs Canyon Staging Area descends 2 miles into Rough Canyon on challenging slickrock and dirt trail with multiple rock features that require a high-clearance 4x4, some skill, and effort. For mountain bikers, this descent is rowdy and fun. The climb out of Rough Canyon is a sustained, loose, technical 4x4 track that will challenge even the most capable motorized users and is a strenuous, difficult climb for MTBers. The reward is access to beautiful terrain and a unique experience. Cresting over the top of this climb, after passing Windmill Road, is an unforgettable experience that transports you to another time. The descent down into 141 is technical, challenging, sustained, and downright gnarly at times. Stock Jeeps will be outmatched in even the most skilled hands. Mountain bikers that love technical descents will have sore faces from grinning so hard. Challenging and amazing in both directions, this trail provides access to the top of Windmill Road and the new Windmill motorized singletrack trail. Descending into Rough Canyon from the East is considered by locals one of the best downhill mountainbike experiences in the Grand Valley and worth the hard work. The remote nature of this trail should not be taken lightly. Any issues on the trail will require a difficult and lengthy rescue by Mesa County Search and Rescue. Significant injuries will likely require a helicopter extraction after a ground team has stabilized the injured party. Go prepared.",2023-06-11 21:02:55,2023-06-11 21:02:55
