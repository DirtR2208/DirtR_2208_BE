                "description": "The Tabeguache Trail is a historic motorized route connecting Grand Junction and Montrose (and likely an original route utilized by local Ute before pushed off by Europeans). It is comprised of several sections and all of them, with the exception of the section within the Lunch Loops, are motorized 4x4 trail/road. Combined, the sections create one third of the Grand Loop bikepacking adventure route. This route is the Granddaddy of bikepacking routes. This section starts at Bangs Canyon Staging Area descends 2 miles into Rough Canyon on challenging slickrock and dirt trail with multiple rock features that require a high-clearance 4x4, some skill, and effort. For mountain bikers, this descent is rowdy and fun. The climb out of Rough Canyon is a sustained, loose, technical 4x4 track that will challenge even the most capable motorized users and is a strenuous, difficult climb for MTBers. The reward is access to beautiful terrain and a unique experience. Cresting over the top of this climb, after passing Windmill Road, is an unforgettable experience that transports you to another time. The descent down into 141 is technical, challenging, sustained, and downright gnarly at times. Stock Jeeps will be outmatched in even the most skilled hands. Mountain bikers that love technical descents will have sore faces from grinning so hard. Challenging and amazing in both directions, this trail provides access to the top of Windmill Road and the new Windmill motorized singletrack trail. Descending into Rough Canyon from the East is considered by locals one of the best downhill mountainbike experiences in the Grand Valley and worth the hard work. The remote nature of this trail should not be taken lightly. Any issues on the trail will require a difficult and lengthy rescue by Mesa County Search and Rescue. Significant injuries will likely require a helicopter extraction after a ground team has stabilized the injured party. Go prepared.",

At approximately 4.5 miles, the road enters Savage Basin and continues through the privately-owned Tomboy Townsite. Remnants from this historic mining town can be seen from the road (Please respect private land by not trespassing on the Tomboy Townsite property). There is ample room to park at Imogene Pass where there are many photo opportunities of the surrounding high alpine terrain. The road then descends into beautiful Imogene Basin, passing through the upper Camp BiRoad Mine site and traversing past a spectacular waterfall before connecting to the Camp BiRoad Road (County Road 361). High clearance, 4-wheel drive vehicles are strongly recommended.",

While most of the road is moderate in difficulty. the mile-long stretch of steep switchbacks on the Telluride side above Bridal Veil Falls is rated as difficult. A high clearance, short wheel base, four wheel drive vehicle is strongly recommended for this section of the road. The road starts from State Highway 550 at Red Mountain Pass (signed as Forest Road #823) and climbs quickly to Black Bear Pass at 3.2 miles. There is ample room for parking at the Pass where there are views into Ingram Basin. The road then descends into Ingram Basin, past Ingram Lake and the Black Bear Mine. At approx. 5.6 miles the road begins descending the \"Steps\" which are comprised of a series of steep, technical rock steps. From this point down to the Bridal Veil Powerplant (approx 1 mile), the road is one-way only. Once down the \"Steps\", the road continues past Ingram Falls, making extremely tight, narrow switchbacks until it reaches the Bridal Veil Falls Powerplant. Driving, riding, or walking down this section of the road is not only a thrill; it also offers spectacular views of the Telluride Valley, Ingram Fall, and Bridal Veil Falls.",

The first portion starting from the bottom is pretty rideable. After the first half mile it gets steeper and more torn up. The further up the trail you get, the more overgrown it is. During the last mile or so at the top it levels off, but is very overgrown and hard to follow.",

Also, there are dirt trails that parallel the paved road if you prefer. The first third of the route is a a steady, rolling climb.
